## Dangerous Drivers
Windows drivers pretty much serve as the mediator for communicating between an operating system and the hardware components of your computer. However, as with any powerful tool, there exists an exploit and this specific one utilizes a driver signature loophole to compromise your security. 


## What do drivers do?
These drivers allow for smooth runs when you’re playing a bulky game that requires that overpriced 4080 ti GPU. It allows the OS to use that graphics card correctly and let you run Starfield without it crashing. These intermediaries are a necessity for your computer to correctly use it’s hardware elements. These instructions from software need to be accurately relayed to the hardware, and vice versa. Thus, drivers support system stability and wield immense performance.

## Getting to the Windows Kernel
Unfortunately, threat actors have been successful in the area they are known for and took advantage of some of these drivers. Using it to get into systems, getting Windows kernel access through the API, and causing mayhem. The Windows API serves as the conduit through which software communicates its intentions to the kernel, which, in turn, performs the hardware's response. Someone with evil intent and access to these resources could cause catastrophic problems.

## Which ones are safe
Over the years, Microsoft has evolved its policies and introduced driver signing. Today, only real Windows developed drivers are authenticated with end-entity certificates after July 29, 2015. This was to reinforce security without leaving legacy software and hardware in the past which many still use today.

## HookSignTool
Enter the notorious HookSignTool—an enabler of malevolence. This tool permits users to manipulate driver signing dates, thereby circumventing the 2015 security measures. Thus unleashing mayhem and endangering digital sanctity.
Risks to Legacy Systems:
The challenge of safeguarding older systems while maintaining security standards continues to grow, for hackers won’t make it easy. Running outdated drivers poses risks, potentially undermining system security and exposing vulnerabilities ripe for the taking.

## Windows kernel
Granting kernel-level access to threat actors is definitely going to cost you. Such access permits unwarranted control over critical system functions, offering the power to manipulate and steal.

## Mitigate
There are a decent number of ways to mitigate such a problem, however it depends on the individual's situation. My personal favorite would be ditching Windows in the franchise OS dumpster and bringing in the Linux distros. However if Tux the penguin isn’t for you or you’d rather not boot Windows within a VM, then there are some Windows solutions as well. Don’t use old hardware. Super simple and easy, the older the hardware the more legacy software that will become a necessity to your system, hence bringing forth the possible fake signatures of verification. Along with all of this you should by default have some malware protection such as detection program, for things never go according to plan.
